Stack:
	Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO(Last in first out) principle.
	
	- Stack has one end only.
	- It contains only one pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack.
	
	eg:
		Recursion
		Do and Un-Do mechanism.
		
	Stack Functions:
		1. push(): use to store element in stack.
		2. pop(): use to remove elment from the top of the stack.
		3. top(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
		4. empty(): Returnns true if stack is empty otherwise false.
		5. size(): return number of elements of stack.
		


Polish Notation:
	This type of notation was introduced by the Polish mathematician Lukasiewicz. 
	- Polish notation in data structure tells us about different ways to write an 
		arithmetic expression. 
		
	- An arithmetic expression contains 2 things:
		1. Operator:
			Operator is a symbol that represents a specific operation to be performed.
			eg:
				+, -, *, /, ^, %

		
		2. Operand:	
			Operand is a value or a variable on which an opertion is performed by an operator.
			eg:
				0 to 9, a to z, A to Z
