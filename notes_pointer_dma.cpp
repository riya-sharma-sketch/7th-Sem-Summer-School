Variable:
	Variable are same as container which is use to store any type of data.
	
Pointer:
	Pointer as special type of variable which is use to store address of anoter
	variable.
	

Reference [ & ]:
	It return the address of given variable.
	
De-Reference [ * ]:
	It return value at given address.
	
	
Types of Pointer:
	1. NULL Pointer:
		Pointer initialize with nullptr is called NULL pointer.
		- it is good practice to initialize pointer with NULL to avoid wild pointer.
		
	
	2. Void pointer:
		Poiner define using void keyword is called void pointer.
		Syntax:
			void * ptr_name = NULL;
			
		- It also known as generic pointer.
		
		
	3. Dangling pointer:
		Pointer which indicate memory which is deallocated.
		
	
	4. Constant Variable:
		Cosntant variable is define using const keyword.
		- we can not override the value of constant variable.
		
		
	5. Constant Pointer:
		Constant pointer is same as Constant variable:
			syntax:
				const data_type * ptr_name = & variable_name;
				
				
Pointer of Pointer:
	It also known as double pointer, use to store address of any pointer:
	
	Syntax:
		data_type ** pointer_name = & another_pointer_name;	
	
	
	
Pointer to function:
	Pointer which indicate address of function.
	
	


Recursion:
	When function call itself is called recursion.
