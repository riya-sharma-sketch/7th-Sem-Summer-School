malloc(): malloc stands for memory allocation, it allocate memory dynamically.
- it allocate memory in bytes.
- we have to pass number of bytes we need to allocate dynamically.
- it return NULL in case of fail to allocate memory.
- it allocate contiguous number of blocks.
- it return void pointer, so need to type cast it.
- it define inside <stdlib.h> header file.
