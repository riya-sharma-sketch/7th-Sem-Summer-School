Constructor:
	Constructor are the function define inside class and function name must be same
	as class name.
	
	- Constructor did not have any return type.
	- We can not call constructor function, it was invoke when object of a class is
		created.
	- constructor can be overload.
	
	- Types of constructor.
	
		1. Default constructor / Non-parameterized constructor:
			Constructor did not have any parameter is called default constructor.
			
		2. Parameterized constructor:
			Constructor having paramenter is called parameterized constructor
			
		3. Copy constructor:
			A constructor that initialized an object using another object of the same
			class.
			- If we not define copy constructor then compiler define it for us.
			
		note:
			for every constructor call, there must have constructor definition 
			other wise it shows an error.	
			
			
Distructor:
	It is use to distroy the object.
	- in other word it deallocate memory allocated by constructor.
	

this keyword:
	this keyword is a constant pointer which contain address of current object.		
			
Static data member:
	It define using static keyword.
	- When static is used with data member in a class, it makes the variable shared
		among all instances of the class.



Template:
	Template is a base of generic programming in C++.
	
Generic Programming:
	Programming which is independent of data type is called generic programming
	
- In C++, implementation of template is perform wia two method:
	1. generic function
	2. generic class
